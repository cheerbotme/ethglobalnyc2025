// This is a Flow Cadence script for deploying the ERC7827 equivalent to Flow testnet
// Note: This is a placeholder as Flow uses a different architecture
// You'll need to implement the equivalent functionality in Cadence

// The actual deployment would be done using the Flow CLI:
// flow accounts create --network testnet
// flow project deploy --network testnet

// For a real deployment, you would need to:
// 1. Create a Flow account (if you don't have one)
// 2. Implement the ERC7827 equivalent in Cadence
// 3. Deploy using the Flow CLI

// This is a placeholder to show where the Flow deployment script would go
// A real implementation would require a separate Cadence contract

pub fun main() {
    log("Flow deployment script placeholder")
    // Implementation would go here
}
